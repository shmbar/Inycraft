							Why Outsource Mobile App Development?
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							There could be a range of reasons why you may not be able to get
							in-house mobile app development services. For example, you may lack the
							necessary equipment, skills, or resources.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							If your in-house development staff is overburdened with tasks, you'll
							need to find a reliable outsourcing development company to assist you
							with mobile app development. This is true for many companies that get
							overwhelmed and then realize they need external help.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Furthermore, mobile app development does not stop after the product is
							out. There is post development support required along with possible
							grades in time to come.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							As a result, companies have two options: make improvements themselves or
							hire a mobile app development company. The latter is a good option, and
							below are some advantages that make outsourcing a feasible business
							solution.
						</p>
					</MotionView>

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 opacity-70">Outsourcing is Economical</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							There’s no mystery about programmers from Eastern Europe's IT cluster
							(Poland or Belarus) costing less than those from Silicon Valley.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Simultaneously, the number of Eastern outsourcing businesses, agencies,
							and individual contractors is rising. Consider Ukraine, where the labor
							market is flooded with excellent programmers (teams and individual
							contractors) that can offer a decent application outsourcing cost.
						</p>
					</MotionView>
					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 opacity-70">Outsourcing Provides Flexibility</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Businesses now expect more flexibility, and they endeavor to adapt,
							expand or reduce the development team shortly and according to their
							business needs.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Additionally, by outsourcing, you can work with any team or with
							individual contractors from any part over the world according to a
							schedule that suits you. So, if you need flexibility in your work,
							outsourcing might be an option that suits you.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							In many areas of collaboration, businesses increasingly desire more
							freedom. Several companies wish to quickly adjust, extend, or downsize
							the development workforce based on business demands.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Furthermore, outsourcing allows you to work with any team or individual
							contractor from anywhere globally at your preferred time. If you want
							flexibility in your work, outsourcing may be the best alternative.

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12">Access to the Talent Pool</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							To ensure your app develops a strong position in the market, and
							depending on the type of app it is, you might need specialists in
							quantum computing, finance, AI, and machine learning. However, finding
							such expertise in the local labor market can be a challenge.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Outsourcing may make things more convenient in this situation. When you
							outsource mobile app development, you have access to a vast pool of
							experts. You may also pick a squad with a convenient time zone and a

							Steps to Outsource App Development
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							So, you've chosen to hire an app development company. That's terrific,
							but how do you know where you should begin? So, it's advisable to take
							your time and figure out what you want out from the team you assemble?
							The following application outsourcing model step by step can help.
						</p>
					</MotionView>

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 opacity-70">
							Step 1: Know your Motive and Goals
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Although a reputable app outsourcing company may help you develop a
							marketing strategy and conduct a business analysis, you must have a
							clear vision of your product. Finding a service provider and setting
							objectives for what you want to achieve at end of the process will be a
							lot easier.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Furthermore, suppose you work with individual app developers rather than
							a company. In that case, the specificity of your plans is even more
							critical because a misconception on any team member’s part might result
							in significant obstacles or even an entirely different app from what you
							intended.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							So, when preparing responses to the following important questions, be as
							clear and as detailed as possible.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">Ask yourself:</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							What are your objectives for your app?
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							What problems should the app solve for users?
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Do you want to make an app for Web, Mobile or both?
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">What if I build a hybrid app?</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							What features are necessary for your app?
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							How do you intend to monetize your app?
						</p>

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 opacity-70">
							Step 2: Research for Best Outsourcing Options
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							The next step is to explore a mobile app development company. However,
							you may ask, “Where should you I look?” Fortunately, as we said earlier,
							there are various hiring portals with profiles of outsourcing companies
							or contractors. Clutch is one source through which you can review some
							of these portals and also gain some input concerning their performance
							based on experience, expertise, and client project fulfillment.
						</p>
					</MotionView>

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 opacity-70">Clutch</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Clutch is a platform where you go when you need an outsourced company.
							This is a highly rated business-to-business database that lists
							outsourcing firms by region, rating, and expertise. Clutch includes
							search options, categories, classifications, and even reviews of
							outsourcing companies to aid you in your search.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							It also provides detailed input concerning each listed company, such as
							technical expertise, clients, portfolios, reviews, and, most
							importantly, it only shows verified software development companies.
							Clients are openly permitted to give their honest feedback regarding
							their project's development, team assistance, support, etc.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Moreover, Clutch also provides quick stats like company focus, minimum
							project size, hourly rates, number of employees, and development track
							record of each company.

							Step 3: Dive Deep to Determine Past Performance
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Assume you're actively seeking a team and interviewing candidates one by
							one. At this stage, it's vital to concentrate on the background of the
							outsourcing development company. Here are some areas to look at to gain
							better insight:
						</p>
					</MotionView>

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 opacity-70">Active Case Studies</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Case studies offer evidence of a team's knowledge, expertise, and
							experience. Outsourcing companies use these to demonstrate their
							expertise and experience, highlight the technology stack they used for
							past projects, and explain why they adopted a particular technical
							methodology.
						</p>
					</MotionView>

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 opacity-70">Industry</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Regulations, technological restrictions, and market rivalry all play a
							role in determining the success of your app. As a result, a team’s
							experience in a particular area can be critical to your success. And so,
							this is a point that you must be aware of.
						</p>
					</MotionView>

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 opacity-70">Past Clients and Projects</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Hearing what others say about your prospective outsourcing partner is a
							useful method for assessment. Examining prior client evaluations is
							another way of learning more about a possible outsourcing partner. You
							may request demo work from organizations or go through prior projects
							that will likely be on their portfolios. This can give you a sense of
							their capabilities.

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl md:text-5xl font-bold mt-12">
							Cost of Outsourcing Mobile App Development
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Your application outsourcing cost can be determined based on a variety
							of factors, including your prospective app's complexity, functionality,
							platform, tools that will be utilized to build it, and few other
							factors. Even the outsourcing company's location has an impact on the
							entire cost of the app. However, due to pricing disparities across
							locations, outsourcing can save you thousands of dollars.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							For instance, North America, Western Europe, and Australia are costly
							locations when it comes to app development, with app developers asking
							for up to $250 per hour. On the other hand, Eastern European developers
							(particularly in Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus) produce software of
							equivalent quality for two to three times less, starting at $30 per hour
							and going up to $110 per hour. While companies in South Asia, East Asia,
							and Africa offer prices as low as $10 per hour.

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl md:text-5xl font-bold mt-12">
							Payment Model for Outsourcing Mobile App Development
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							If you opt for outsource mobile app development, there are two payment
							models to consider:
						</p>
					</MotionView>

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 opacity-70">Hourly Payment</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							The most common, transparent, and flexible payment model is the hourly
							payment one, which allows you to pay just for the duration your team
							works, and you can modify the scope or team composition at any given
							time during the development process.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							However, because you can't always forecast how long app development will
							take, hourly pricing provides you with less financial control.
							Therefore, this approach is best suited for companies with minimal
							understanding of the target market or the project scope is under rapid
							development.
						</p>
					</MotionView>

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 opacity-70">Fixed Payment</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Fixed payments have a minimal chance of unwelcomed surprises, additional
							charges, or mistrust, but also lacks flexibility due to the time and
							effort required to provide thorough specifications and calculate the
							duration. A fixed payment makes sense if your project is small and you
							can readily foresee how long it will take.
						</p>
					</MotionView>

					<MotionView dr={0.5} dl={0} yIn="2rem">
						<p className="text-3xl md:text-5xl font-bold mt-12">Final Words</p>
						<p className="leading-8 text-lg mt-8">
							Hopefully, the question concerning how to outsource app development will
							no longer be as intimidating as it was. Outsourcing application
							development is the most cost-effective alternative, especially if you
							are a small company with limited resources. Of course, outsourcing isn't
							a magic wand since there are some risks to consider, but they may be
							avoided when hire with professionals with the right expertise and
							experience.
